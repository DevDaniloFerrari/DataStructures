# Data Structures

### Singly Linked List
A Singly Linked List is a linear data structure in which each element, called a node, consists of two parts: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The last node typically points to null, indicating the end of the list. This structure allows for efficient insertions and deletions at the beginning or end of the list but may require sequential traversal to access elements.

### Doubly Linked List
A Doubly Linked List is similar to a Singly Linked List, but with an additional reference in each node, pointing to the previous node in the sequence. This bidirectional linkage allows for efficient traversal in both directions and supports operations like insertions and deletions at any position in the list. However, it requires more memory due to the extra reference.

### Circular Linked List
A Circular Linked List is a variation of a Singly or Doubly Linked List in which the last node points back to the first node, creating a closed loop. This structure is often used when you need continuous access to the elements in a loop-like fashion. Circular Linked Lists can be implemented using both singly and doubly linked nodes.

In summary, these three types of linked lists offer different trade-offs in terms of efficiency and functionality. Singly Linked Lists are simple and efficient for insertion and deletion at the beginning, Doubly Linked Lists provide bidirectional traversal and more flexibility, and Circular Linked Lists are used when you need continuous looping behavior. The choice of which to use depends on the specific requirements of your data and the operations you need to perform.
